# Fluidsvelte
Fluidsvelte is an experimental Python-based full-stack web framework that unifies frontend and backend development using a component-based approach inspired by Svelte to extend developments of Fluidframe. It allows developers to write full-stack components in a single file using Python, HTML, CSS and optional Javascript/Typescript.
